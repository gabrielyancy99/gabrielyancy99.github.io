		<h3 class="show-on-scroll">About Me</h3>
		<div style="margin-top: -2vh" class="wrapper">
			<div id="mobile"><p class="show-on-scroll">I am currently a PhD student in the Simoncelli lab at New York University's Center for Neural Science in the Systems, Cognition, and Computation track. My research focuses on diffusion models, image processing, computational models of vision, psychophysics, fMRI, and models of noise. I work in the Simoncelli Lab developing methods for controlled image synthesis and analyzing corresponding neural population recordings to explore representation in V2.
				I am also intereested in applying these methods to understand general visual representations using behavioral and neuroimaging data.
						</p>
			<br  />
				<p class="show-on-scroll">Prior to starting my PhD, I worked in the Behnia lab at Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute as a research technician studying the mechanisms of color learning and 
					multi-sensory memory formation using the fruit fly as a model organism. This work involved experimentation using fly husbandry techniques, genetic tools, dissection, and two-photon microscopy, 
					as well as theory through the development of analysis pipelines and building of models for understanding population-level dynamics and encoding/decoding. While at Fordham I worked with Dr. 
					Stephen Keeley to develop a model for performing dimensionality reduction of multi-region neural data to capture both shared and region-independent latent subspaces. This work was done in 
					collaboration with experimentalists at other institutions who provided data which we used for analysis and led to a COSYNE poster presented in 2022.</p>
			<br  />
				<p class="show-on-scroll">My interests are in the computational modelling of neural circuits and behavior especially in relation to sensory and perceptual processing across species. I am also 
					interested in the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning, particularly in developing models that can both explain neural data and inspire new computational approaches.

		<p class="show-on-scroll">Aside from research, I have played piano since I was 5 years old and continue to enjoy playing a variety of genres of music from classical and ensemble work to jazz and showtunes. I also engage with other arts and take myself to be a general hobbiest, picking up random skills and crafts out of both curiosity and enjoyment.</p>
