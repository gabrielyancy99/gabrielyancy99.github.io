			<div id="mobile"><p class="show-on-scroll">I am currently a PhD student at New York University's Center for Neural Science in the Systems, Cognition, and Computation track. My research focuses on diffusion models, image processing, computational models of vision, psychophysics, fMRI, and models of noise. I work in the Simoncelli Lab developing methods for controlled image synthesis and analyzing corresponding neural population recordings to explore representation in V2.

				<p class="show-on-scroll">Prior to starting my PhD, I worked in the Behnia lab at Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute as a research technician studying the mechanisms of color learning and multi-sensory memory formation using the fruit fly as a model organism. This work involved experimentation using fly husbandry techniques, genetic tools, dissection, and two-photon microscopy, as well as theory through the development of analysis pipelines and building of models for understanding population-level dynamics and encoding/decoding. While at Fordham I worked with Dr. Stephen Keeley to develop a model for performing dimensionality reduction of multi-region neural data to capture both shared and region-independent latent subspaces. This work was done in collaboration with experimentalists at other institutions who provided data which we used for analysis and led to a COSYNE poster presented in 2022.</p>
			<br  />
				<p class="show-on-scroll">My interests are in the computational modelling of neural circuits and behavior especially in relation to understanding the general structures of neural computations across species. I also have interests in the development of technology with the purpose of better understanding or taking advantage of the principles behind neural computation.</p>

		<p class="show-on-scroll">Aside from research, I have played piano since I was 5 years old and continue to enjoy playing a variety of genres of music from classical and ensemble work to jazz and showtunes. I also engage with other arts and take myself to be a general hobbiest, picking up random skills and crafts out of both curiosity and enjoyment.</p>
